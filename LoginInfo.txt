So in an effort to move to a unified and scalable service, I have created for 
us an account on the hosting website OpenShift.com. Using OpenShift is actually
pretty simple, and I already have everything we need up and running, but of 
course we'll need to do some editing to the Node code as well as get the
MongoDB set up and working. As of right now there is a simple chat room
set up at:

http://nodejs-stackframe.rhcloud.com/

This is where we'll send and receive requests from our app, but navigating 
there presents you with a simple HTML page for testing. As far as making
actual changes to the server (which we won't have to do often), you can head
to the OpenShift developer console at: 

https://openshift.redhat.com/app/login?then=%2Fapp%2Fconsole
username: dburnsii@email.arizona.edu
password: W1ldcats

That will take you to the portal from which you can see everything going on.
In order to make changes to the code, Openshift uses git to update and refresh
the servers. In order to make changes:

1. Install git if you don't have it already:

sudo apt-get install git

2. Clone the Git repository

git clone ssh://56202eea0c1e66ed60000088@nodejs-stackframe.rhcloud.com/~/git/nodejs.git/ [DirectoryToCloneTo]

3. Make changes locally

4. Push the changes to the server, it'll give you the console output of the server
in the terminal window you push from

git add [files to add ("." for all)]
git commit
git push

Besides making changes to the code, you'll also want to install rhc, which gives
you remote control over the server without having to SSH or authenticate every time

sudo apt-get install rhc

OR

sudo apt-get install ruby-full
sudo apt-get install rubygems
sudo gem install rhc


THEN

gem install net-ssh -v 2.9.3.beta1
rhc setup

With that, you will be given access to the tools and options that will allow
you to start and stop the server, along with other functions we may need
going forward. With that, we shouldn't need to much else regarding server
services, and scaling up the app will be very easy with the inexpensive and
flexible pricing options that OpenShift offers. Lets do this guys!
